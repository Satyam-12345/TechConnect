**TechConnect: Bridging the Digital Divide with Conversational AI**

**Concept: AI-Powered Platform for Digital Inclusion**

TechConnect is an AI-powered platform designed to make essential digital services (Travel, Healthcare, Education) accessible and intuitive for everyone, particularly those facing barriers related to digital literacy, language, and low connectivity. The core goal is to deploy an intelligent virtual assistant that simplifies complex tasks (like booking tickets or checking symptoms) into clear, step-by-step guidance, even functioning efficiently in low-bandwidth areas.

💡 Prototype Overview (What's in this Repository)

This repository contains the functional client-side prototype built to validate the conversational user experience (UX) and multi-domain flow.

**Functionality:** Simulates core conversational features for Train Booking, PNR Status checks, Symptom Diagnosis, and Educational Content Retrieval.

**Voice Feature:** Uses bi-lingual voice interaction (English/Hindi) via the browser's native Web Speech API.

**Limitation:** All transactional data, search results, and logic are mocked using local JavaScript arrays and logic. This is purely a proof-of-concept for the interface.
